 Print variable "numb" as long as "numb" is less or equal to 8. numb should start at 1. numb should be added 1.5 each time it is executed (use shortcut operators)
 numb = 1
 while numb <= 8:
     print (numb)
     numb =+ numb + 1.5


 Average LoopAssignment. Take integer inputs from user until he/she presses q (Ask to press q to quit after every integer input). Print average and product of all numero
 numero = int(input('GIVE ME A numero: '))
 confirmar = input('PRESS ENTER TO COTINUE, "Q" TO STOP THE PROGRAM AND GET THE RESULTS')
 count = 1

 while confirmar != 'q':
     numero = numero + int(input('GIVE ME ANOTHER numero: '))
     confirmar = input('PRESS ENTER TO COTINUE, "Q" TO STOP THE PROGRAM AND GET THE RESULTS: ')
     count += 1
     if confirmar == 'q':
         print('The average is:', numero/count)
         print('The product is:')


  Factorial Calculation
 from os import sep
 num = int(input('GIVE ME A NUMBER: '))
 num2 = num
 factorial = 1
 while num > 0:
     factorial = factorial * num
     num -= 1
 print('The factorial !',num2, ' ', 'is: ', factorial, sep='')
